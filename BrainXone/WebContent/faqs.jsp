			<h1 class="page-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

			1. What is QuiZone?<br> QuiZone is a great place for users to
			write and share great content. As the name suggests, this is a cool
			zone to make, take and share quizzes. Whether you want to create,
			take and share quizzes and challenge your friends, QuiZone has
			something for everyone! <br>
			<br> 2. How Long Has QuiZone Been Around?<Br> We are pretty
			new! Launched on 13th March. Dynamic team of 5 Stanford students -
			Aparna Bhat, Xinhui Zou, Zheng Wu, Graham Roth, Kyle Archie. <br>
			<br> 3. Are all the quizzes made by one person?<br> No. All
			the quizzes on QuiZone are made by individual users. Anyone can sign
			up for a free account and begin making quizzes, friends and have fun!
			<br>
			<br> 4. How do I create a new account? <br> It's simple.
			Just click the "Register" link displayed in the login box on any page
			and sign up. It's free. Or click <a href="create_new_account.jsp">here. </a> <br>
			<br> 5. What's required for a new account?<br> All you need
			is valid username that hasn't been taken.<br>
			<br> 6. Why do I need an account?<br> You need an account
			to take full advantage of all the site has to offer. To simply take
			quizzes, tests, challenge friends, send messages, make friends, see
			other content, you definitely do need an account. This will also
			allow you to create and rate content, save your quiz results, add
			users to your Friends list, message other users, leave comments,
			etc., Probably a good idea to be a logged in as a registered user. <br>
			<br> 7. How do I create a quiz?<br> First open up the quiz
			editor by either clicking "Creator Mode" under the Quizzes drop-down
			menu at the top of any page. If asked to select a quiz type, choose a
			category, name, description and other options. This will open up the
			quiz editor. Once there, creating a quiz is simple. The editor is set
			up so that you can "click to edit." For example, if you want to
			change the title, just click on it. A text box will appear where you
			can begin typing. When you're happy with the text, hit "Submit Quiz."
			<br>
			<br> 8. What is my QuiZone Profile? <br> Your QuiZone
			Profile is a public information page about you and what you have done
			on the site. It shows: your username, your creations, some of the
			friends on your friends list.<br>
	
			<br> 9. What exactly are "friends?"<br> Friends are simply
			other users you've chosen to add to your "Friends" list. To add a
			user to your friends list, you need to visit their page and send them
			a request. You are asked to confirm when other users add you as a
			friend, so not anyone can be "friends" with you. You can see their activity and they can see yours. Privacy setting doesn't affect friends visibility. <br>
			<br> 10. How do I take someone off my "friends"?<br>
			After logging into the site, go to the corresponding user's profile
			and then click the "Remove Friend" button. That user will no longer appear
			on your "Friends" list. <br>
			<br> 11. What are the Top Rated Quizzes and how do I get one of
			my creations on one? <br> The Top Rated lists feature the
			highest-rated quizzes published, as voted on by QuiZone users. They
			are updated as soon as a user reviews a quiz. A piece of content must
			have been rated multiple times to qualify for this list. Only the top
			are chosen. <br>
			<br> 12. How does search work?<br> The search engine is new
			and improved and is now faster and more accurate. Searching for all
			users and quizzes by tags. To search for content, just enter a
			keyword into the search page in the welcome page and click on the
			"search". You'll be taken to the search results page, where you can
			sort displayed results by relevance and partial match for usernames
			and quiz tags date. <br>
			<br> 13. Someone's quiz/message is inappropriate. What should I
			do? <br> Use the "Report It" feature. Go to the user's profile
			page and click the "Report It" button. Flag as inappropriate. Our
			admins will read your report and address it as they see fit. <br>
